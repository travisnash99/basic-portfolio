	   	<p> My name is Travis Nash. I am currently a student in the UT Coding Bootcamp. I am 28 years old and undergoing a career change. I currently live in Austin, Texas. I grew up in a small village in the Land of Oz, just south of the great city of Wichita. I did have a dog, but his name was Boomer, not Toto. He ran away one time and I watched him run away for about 10 miles. Oz is very flat and desolate. He didn't really run away, but that attempt at a joke gives you an idea of what it's like living in Oz. Any ways, this has gone on too long already.

		This website took a lot of work to make, and hope that my skills are sufficient
